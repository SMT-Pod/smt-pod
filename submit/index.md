## SMT-V Submission Guidelines

SMT-V seeks video submissions showcasing original research or demonstrating an original pedagogical approach. The medium of video offers unique opportunities for the communication of theoretical ideas through the integration of images, spoken word, performance, musical scores, recorded audio, and/or animated visualizations. We are particularly interested in topics that will be well served by video presentation and have the potential to engage both specialists within the field and interested viewers outside the music theory community. If you have questions or preliminary ideas for a video-article that you would like to discuss, feel free to contact the [SMT-V Editor](mailto:SMT-V-editor@societymusictheory.org).

### Length 
Videos should communicate content as concisely and directly as possible, with a maximum length of 15 minutes.

### Review of Submissions
Submissions will be evaluated in two stages. Authors will first submit a proposal, and then (if the proposal is judged as suitable) a script/storyboard draft that will be sent to peer evaluators for anonymous double-blind review. If the script/storyboard draft is accepted, the author would be invited to produce a video, which would be subject to an open, collaborative review process before being accepted for publication. Send the proposal to the [SMT-V Editor](mailto:SMT-V-editor@societymusictheory.org).

### Stage I: Abstract and Storyboard/Script Draft
The author’s initial submission should take the form of a PDF that includes an abstract of no more than 500 words, and back matter of no more than 4 additional pages that complements the abstract with notation, images, tables, bibliography, and so forth. This abstract-proposal will be subject to double-blind review, with a quick turnaround. Pending approval of this abstract, the applicant will be invited to provide a storyboard or script, which will again be submitted to the full double-blind review process.

### Stage II: Video Submission
Upon acceptance of your proposal, you will be asked to produce a full video in conjunction with guidance and assessment from selected members of the Editorial Board.

If you are new to producing your own video, here are some suggestions:

- Using a USB microphone will significantly improve the quality of recording. A computer’s built-in microphone often adds distortion and noise.
- Try to speak in a natural, extemporaneous manner rather than merely reading your script word-for-word.
- If you choose to include footage of yourself speaking, make eye contact with the camera, and avoid light reflections on your glasses.
- Stabilize the camera by resting it on a surface or tripod.
- Each individual shot should be not less than 5 seconds long. Shorter shots create jumpy footage that can be difficult to track.
- If you collaborate with a musician, dancer, etc. in your video please acknowledge your collaborator in the title of your video and in supporting material.

See our [Resources](resources.md) section for more information on recording slideshows and on video production. In addition, many schools have Media Services departments who can assist you with creating your video.
