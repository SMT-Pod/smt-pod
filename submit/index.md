# Pitch a Pod: _SMT-Pod_ Submission Guidelines

>**Currently accepting submissions for Season 1!**\
>Submissions received by July 31, 2021 will be given full consideration.\
>Submissions received after this date will be considered for Season 2.

## Overview

_SMT-Pod_ is a peer-reviewed, collaborative, and creative venue for timely conversations about music theory. Audio-only podcasts offer a unique—though non-traditional—way of engaging with music, analysis, and contemporary issues in the field. As opposed to the heavy, jargon-laden publications we are used to working through at our desks, _SMT-Pod_ publications are easy to listen to and think about in the car, on your run, or while grading.\
\
	The format of each episode is dictated by its content. For some topics, interviews with individual scholars or panel discussions may be effective; for others, sample lessons may prove useful; for more traditional analysis topics (that would not require visual aids), single-author lectures with plenty of audio examples may suffice. If none of these formats seem beneficial to the episode you are proposing, feel free to design your own. The choice is up to you!\
\
If you think you have an idea for SMT-Pod, here are some things you should prepare/consider as we work together to create your podcast. 
The initial proposal (300–500 words) should include information about the topic, format, and content of your episode. You’ll submit your proposal on this Google Form, where you’ll also be asked about the structure of the episode and any technological needs you may have. You can see specifics about the rest of the process below.\
\
We welcome proposals from all scholars: those who are avid podcast listeners and those who are less familiar with the medium; whether you have years of experience or are new to the recording process.

### Publication Process
*Phase 1: Proposal and initial review*\
    *Submission of 300–500 word episode proposal 
Submitted via this Google Form
Include:  
Topic of episode
Format of episode (single-author presentation, panel discussion, “tiny desk concert,” etc.)
Length of episode (short (10–20 min.), medium (20–30 min.), long (30–45 min.))
Identifying information for all creators/participants (these will not be reviewed anonymously)
Set of keywords
If relevant, include why this topic is best addressed in a podcast format (as opposed to in a written article, SMT-V video, etc.)
Program Committee evaluates the proposal individually (Open, collaborative peer review including communication between program committee and author), considering:
Suitability for a podcast format
Creation of a diverse set of topics in a season
Possibility of reaching out to scholars in the field for commentary, relevant review, and/or contribution to the episode
Meeting SMT’s language guidelines, policy on ethics, and policy on harassment 
Meeting with the proposer(s) to discuss:
What podcast format would work best
What topics should/can be covered
Sources or persons to be added to the conversation?
Needed technological support
Phase 2: Recording and production
Proposer sends in a list of topics/questions and/or outline before recording 
Preparation of podcast episode with production committee (recording, editing, choosing bumper music)
After recording, files are sent to the Tech Committee.
Any and all changes will be made in conversation with the proposer
Phase 3: Post-production and second outside review
Author-chosen third-party peer/colleague (“reviewer”) listens to the episode and approves/collaborates. The third-party reviewer should not have any conflicts of interest or implicit bias which would compromise the integrity of the process. This third-party peer review could take the form of any of the following:
Approval for release
Working with the author(s) to improve/add to the podcast before release
Providing a short segment at the end of the podcast with their commentary
A promise of a follow-up episode
A combination of the above and/or any other formats (with approval from the Program Committee and the author(s))

### Format 
- Videos should communicate content as concisely and directly as possible. They are usually around 10 minutes long. The maximum length for an _SMT-V_ video-article is 15 minutes.
- The videos should be self-standing, not adjuncts to a written text.
- The final screens of the videos could contain a bibliography and acknowledgements.
- The videos will be published one at a time on a regular basis, with previous videos archived on the website.
- The video-articles undergo double-blind review; each _SMT-V_ publication is a peer-reviewed article.
- As of 2020, _SMT-V_ no longer accepts multi-part videos (though separate videos on related subjects are still welcome).
- At no time may authors have more than one single-authored video article and one joint-authored video article under proposal review, accepted for storyboarding and in process, under storyboard review, accepted for production and in process, or completed and waiting to be published.

### Submissions
Submissions will be evaluated in three stages. (1) Authors submit a short proposal to the [_SMT-V_ editor](mailto:SMT-V-editor@societymusictheory.org), who will arrange for double-blind review with quick turnaround. (2) If the proposal is judged as suitable, a script/storyboard draft will be sent to peer evaluators for double-blind review. (3) If the script/storyboard draft is accepted, the author is invited to produce a video in collaboration with the editors; the final version would be subject to a final approval by the editors before publication.

Throughout the process, authors and prospective authors are invited to consult our [Resources](resources.md) page for information about creating video articles.

#### Stage I: Abstract and Storyboard/Script Draft
The author’s initial submission should take the form of a PDF that includes an abstract of no more than 500 words, and back matter of no more than 4 additional pages that complements the abstract with notation, images, tables, bibliography, and so forth. This abstract-proposal will be subject to double-blind review with a quick turnaround. 

#### Stage II: Storyboard and/or Script Draft
Pending approval of this abstract, the applicant will be invited to provide a storyboard or script (or both), which will again be subjected to the full double-blind review process. (In special circumstances, authors can also request to send a video draft at this stage instead of a storyboard/script, subject to the approval of the editors; ask the _SMT-V_ Editor for details.) If more than twenty-four months elapse between acceptance of a storyboard or script and production of a video article, the storyboard or script will re-enter the review process before video production can begin.

#### Stage III: Video Submission
Upon acceptance of the storyboard/script, authors will be asked to produce a full video in conjunction with guidance and assessment from selected members of the Editorial Board. The Board can help with all the technical details in putting together the video, and it is also possible for SMT to provide funds to allay the costs of filming, recording, etc. Authors are also invited to produce their own videos; if you choose to do so, see our [Resources](resources.md) page for suggestions.
