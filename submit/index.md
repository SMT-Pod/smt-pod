## SMT-V Submission Guidelines

SMT-V seeks video submissions showcasing original research or demonstrating a creative and engaging approach to presenting topics that relate to music theory and analysis. We are particularly interested in topics that will be well-served by video presentation and have the potential to engage both specialists within the field and interested viewers outside the music theory community. The medium of video offers unique opportunities for the communication of theoretical ideas through the integration of images, spoken word, performance, musical scores, recorded audio, and/or animated visualizations. If you have questions or preliminary ideas for a video-article that you would like to discuss, feel free to contact the [SMT-V Editor](mailto:SMT-V-editor@societymusictheory.org).

### Format 
- Videos should communicate content as concisely and directly as possible. They are usually around 10 minutes long. The maximum length for an _SMT-V_ video-article is 15 minutes.
- The videos should be self-standing, not adjuncts to a written text.
- The final screens of the videos could contain a bibliography and acknowledgements.
- The videos will be published one at a time on a regular basis, with previous videos archived on the website.
- The video-articles undergo double-blind review; each _SMT-V_ publication is a peer-reviewed article.

### Submissions
Submissions will be evaluated in three stages. (1) Authors submit a short proposal to the [_SMT-V_ editor](mailto:SMT-V-editor@societymusictheory.org), who will arrange for double-blind review with quick turnaround. (2) If the proposal is judged as suitable, a script/storyboard draft will be sent to peer evaluators for double-blind review. (3) If the script/storyboard draft is accepted, the author is invited to produce a video in collaboration with the editors; the final version would be subject to a final approval by the editors before publication.

### Stage I: Abstract and Storyboard/Script Draft
The authorâ€™s initial submission should take the form of a PDF that includes an abstract of no more than 500 words, and back matter of no more than 4 additional pages that complements the abstract with notation, images, tables, bibliography, and so forth. This abstract-proposal will be subject to double-blind review with a quick turnaround. 

### Stage II: Storyboard and/or Script Draft
Pending approval of this abstract, the applicant will be invited to provide a storyboard or script (or both), which will again be submitted to the full double-blind review process. (In special circumstances, authors can also request to send a video draft at this stage instead of a storyboard/script, subject to the approval of the editors; as the _SMT-V_ Editor for details.)

### Stage III: Video Submission
Upon acceptance of the storyboard/script, authors will be asked to produce a full video in conjunction with guidance and assessment from selected members of the Editorial Board. The Board can help with all the technical details in putting together the video, and it is also possible for SMT to provide funds to allay the costs of filming, recording, etc. Authors are also invited to produce their own videos; if you choose to do so, see our [Resources](resources.md) page for suggestions.
