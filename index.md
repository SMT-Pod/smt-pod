*György Kurtág’s four-handed piano works often demonstrate a highly unorthodox distribution of the primo and second parts in which the embodied, physical interactions between the two pianists play a central role in the composition. A sense of the variety of ways in which this interaction can be realized may be witnessed in two movement’s from Kurtág’s Games (Játékok) VII: “Flowers we are . . .” (Virág az ember...”) and “Beating Quarreling” (“ Verés - veszekedés”).*
