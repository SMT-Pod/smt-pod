### Anne Young’s *Introduction to Music* (1803): Pedagogical, Speculative, and Ludic Music Theory
Carmel Raz (Max Planck Institute for Empirical Aesthetics)

*Though ostensibly designed to explain a set of pedagogical games geared toward children, An Introduction to Music (1803)—a treatise by the Scottish music theorist Anne Young (1756-1827)—advances some intriguing ideas that touch on advanced music theoretic concepts. This video explores these concepts, along with impact of the author's gender on the nature and reception of her treatise.*

*Keywords: history of music theory, history of music pedagogy, educational games, women in music theory*
