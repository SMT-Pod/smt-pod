*C.P.E. Bach once testified how his father, J.S. Bach, could anticipate if and how the subject of a fugue might contrapuntally combine with other lines later in the composition.
This video equips the viewer with a method to do this regarding canonic combinations in particular, using stretto combinations from Clara Schumannâ€™s fugue op. 16, no. 3.*

*Keywords: canon, stretto, counterpoint, J. S. Bach, Clara Schumann*

*DOI forthcoming*
