*This video-article presents the concept of "essential voices" in Bach's solo instrumental works, which explains how notes can be connected together or implied so as to form continuous musical voices that support the solo part. The contrapuntal lines that essential voices highlight are often repeated in transformed ways within movements to relate different thematic rotations and heighten the musical drama. The video concludes with an analysis and performance of the intriguing Sarabande from J.S. Bach's Cello Suite No. 5 in C Minor, BWV 1011, accompanied by a four-part setting of essential voices for cello ensemble.*

*A standard feature of many numbers in musical theater is a highly contrasting section known as a “detour." Detours function in dialog with the standard bridge section in various fascinating ways, as may be seen in selections from the musicals Wicked, Everyday Rapture, and Legally Blonde.*

*György Kurtág’s four-handed piano works often demonstrate a highly unorthodox distribution of the primo and second parts in which the embodied, physical interactions between the two pianists play a central role in the composition. A sense of the variety of ways in which this interaction can be realized may be witnessed in two movement’s from Kurtág’s Games (Játékok) VII: “Flowers we are . . .” (Virág az ember...”) and “Beating Quarreling” (“ Verés - veszekedés”).*
