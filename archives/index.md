### "Was it Diegetic, or Just a Dream? Music's Paradoxical Place in the Film *Inception* 
Christopher Doll (Rutgers University)

*Between "diegetic" film music (heard by the characters) and "nondiegetic" film music (heard only by the audience) is a paradoxical space called the "fantastical gap." A film such as Inception (2010) makes traversal of this gap into an overt theme, obscuring our sense of place to such a degree that even the literal plot of the movie is open to interpretation, and thus also illustrating the extent to which filmmakers can manipulate an audience's understanding of the filmic world through the blurring of the diegetic/nondiegetic divide.*

### Music, Poetry, and Performance in a Song by Maria Schneider
Stephen Rodgers (University of Oregon)

*In this video I explore the way song composers respond not just to the meanings of words but also to their sounds. Using a song from Maria Schneiderâ€™s 2013 song cycle Winter Morning Walks as a case study, I consider how a particular performance of a song and a particular performance of a poem can heighten our awareness of the connections between music and the materiality of poetry.*
