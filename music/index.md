As part of our mission to include diverse voices in our scholarship, _SMT-Pod_ aims to showcase a variety of music in our podcast. We encourage SMT members and non-members alike to submit their compositions for both theme and bumper music. All music will be credited verbally on the episode and in writing here.

### Call for Theme/Bumper Music
The Society for Music Theory’s _SMT-Pod_ committee seeks submissions from composers for the launch of its inaugural podcast. Applicants are invited to submit 15–30 seconds of music for the podcast’s theme music and/or 5–10 seconds of music for the podcast’s opening and closing bumper. Episodes of SMT-Pod will be regularly heard by SMT’s 1000+ membership, with listenership extending into the composition, performance, and pedagogy communities. A composer will be verbally credited by name (as desired) on every _SMT-Pod_ episode on which the composer’s music is used.

The _SMT-Pod_ committee has no pre-conceived style or tone considerations. SMT is committed to fostering diversity and inclusivity in the field and welcomes submissions encompassing any and all musical styles and compositional approaches. To clarify: we welcome submissions from composers in genres and styles not traditionally conceived as ‘classical’ or ‘concert’ music, as well as those that are. Composers of all ages, genres/styles, countries of residence, and career stages are encouraged to apply.Submit the music that best expresses your artistic voice and would work well in a podcast context!

Composers identifying as women, underrepresented gender expression or sexual orientation, underrepresented ethnic or racial communities (BIPOC), neurodivergent persons or persons with a disability, and/or any underrepresented communities are encouraged to apply.

_SMT-Pod_ will feature recurring theme music in every episode, while the bumper music will be different within each episode.

* *Theme music:* Recurrent during the each season of the podcast
* *Bumper music:* Used as incidental, background, and transition music

<ol style="padding-top: 15px;">
<li>Submissions for the theme music should be 15–30 seconds in duration. Submissions for the bumpers should be 5–10 seconds in duration. The <em>SMT-Pod</em> committee may select an excerpt of a theme music submission for the bumpers.</li>

<li>Composers may submit up to three entries for the theme music and bumper music combined (whether excerpts from the same piece or from different pieces). For example a composer could submit:</li>
  <ul>
      <li>2 submissions for theme music and 1 for bumpers</li>
      <li>2 submissions for bumper music and 1 for theme</li>
      <li>3 submissions for theme music</li>
      <li>3 submissions for bumper music</li></ul>

<li>Submissions may be audio excerpts of larger works (composers must trim the audio file to the desired excerpt prior to submission). If so, the audio file should either begin and end at a natural-sounding point or fade in and/or out in an appropriate manner for a podcast. If a score is provided, mark the score to indicate where the audio excerpt begins and ends. In the PDF, please include only the score’s frontmatter and pages including the audio excerpt.</li>

<li>Upload audio and score files to a file-sharing service such as Google Drive and provide the sharing links in the Application Form. Ensure that there is no expiration date on the sharing and that anyone with the shared link can download the file. It is the composers’ responsibility to make sure file-sharing availability is maintained – the <em>SMT-Pod</em> will not reach out to composers about a broken link.</li>

<li>Before submitting, be sure that there are no copyright issues with the audio you are proposing. Audio files may not have record label claims on them such that the recording’s use in the SMT-Pod requires royalty payments to a label. Pieces may not contain use of a sample that would be subject to copyright claim.</li>

<li>If submitting a MIDI mockup as your audio file, a score PDF is recommended to demonstrate your full intent for the music. You may submit a MIDI mockup for a piece you intend to record live later; mention this in the comments and it will be taken into consideration. Please note that <em>SMT-Pod</em> will not provide resources for live recordings. Include in the comments a description of when the piece will be recorded live and when final audio may be expected.</li>

<li>The <em>SMT-Pod</em> committee intends to select multiple options for bumper music to use in rotation from episode to episode, reflecting the diversity of music-making in today’s world.</li>
