## SMT-V: The Society for Music Theory Videocast Journal



### Purpose

SMT-V is a peer-reviewed publication consisting of videos of short to moderate length to be hosted on—or accessible by links from—the SMT website.
- The videos should deal with some scholarly aspect of music theory or analysis, geared either towards the music theory professional or towards members of the educated public. Although some videos might deal with topics of music theory pedagogy research, they should not be geared directly towards beginning harmony students.
- The videos should be self-standing, not adjuncts to a written text.
- The final screens of the videos could contain a bibliography and acknowledgements.
- The videos will be published one at a time on a regular basis, with previous videos archived on the website.

## Organization

- SMT-V is overseen by an Editor who organizes the vetting of the videos, along with an Associate Editor who aids with the technical details.
- Members of an Editorial Board help vet the videos.

## Vetting

Those wishing to publish a video on _SMT-V_ should first submit a written proposal summarizing the proposed project. If the proposed project is deemed appropriate, the author will be invited to submit a draft of a storyboard or script. Upon acceptance of the script, the author will be invited to produce a full video in conjunction with guidance and assessment from selected members of the Editorial Board. Details regarding the submission process are found at [https://societymusictheory.org/smt-v/submission_guidelines](https://societymusictheory.org/smt-v/submission_guidelines).

If you have any questions about the process, please feel free to contact the [SMT-V Editor](mailto:SMT-V-editor@societymusictheory.org).
