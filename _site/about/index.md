### Mission Statement
_SMT-Pod_ is a creative venue for timely conversations about music, with episodes chosen through an open, collaborative peer review process. Audio-only podcasts offer a unique—though non-traditional—way of engaging with music, analysis, and contemporary issues in the field. This new publication medium affords our society both the ability to face outwards, by engaging in public scholarship, and inwards, by hosting meaningful conversations about the activity of music analysis. The variety of episode topics will reflect the diversity of the scholars and their scholarship in our field, making _SMT-Pod_ an invaluable publication for music analysts at any stage. Through its goal of promoting a sense of community and inclusivity, _SMT-Pod_ will reach beyond the boundaries of the SMT at this critical moment of calls for the revitalization of our field
