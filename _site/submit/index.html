<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>

<p><em>SMT-Pod</em> is a <a href="OCPR">Open Collaborative Peer-Reviewed</a> and creative venue for timely conversations about music theory. Audio-only podcasts offer a unique—though non-traditional—way of engaging with music, analysis, and contemporary issues in the field. As opposed to the heavy, jargon-laden publications we are used to working through at our desks, <em>SMT-Pod</em> publications are easy to listen to and think about in the car, on your run, or while grading.<br />
<br />
The <a href="https://castos.com/podcast-format/" target="_blank">format</a> of each episode is dictated by its content. For some topics, interviews with individual scholars or panel discussions may be effective; for others, sample lessons may prove useful; for more traditional analysis topics (that would not require visual aids), single-author lectures with plenty of audio examples may suffice. If none of these formats seem beneficial to the episode you are proposing, feel free to design your own. The choice is up to you!<br />
<br />
We welcome proposals from all scholars: those who are avid podcast listeners and those who are less familiar with the medium; whether you have years of experience or are new to the recording process.</p>

<h3 id="publication-process">Publication Process</h3>

<p>If you think you have an idea for SMT-Pod, here are some things you should prepare/consider as we work together to create your podcast using an open collaborative peer-review process.</p>

<p style="font-size: 16px; text-align: center; font-style: italic;"><strong><a href="../submit/OCPR">Read more about why we use an <br />Open Collaborative Peer Review (OCPR) Process here</a></strong></p>

<p>The initial proposal (300–500 words) should include information about the topic, <a href="https://castos.com/podcast-format/" target="_blank">format</a>, and content of your episode. You’ll submit your proposal on this <a href="https://forms.gle/C9i76uoeXsXbwMAb8">Google Form</a>, where you’ll also be asked about the structure of the episode and any technological needs you may have. You can see specifics about the rest of the process below (click to open each phase):</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; padding-top: 15px;"><a href="OCPR">Open Collaborative Peer Review</a> by Program Committee</p>

  <ul><li>All proposals will be reviewed by the <a href="../about#program-committee">program committee of SMT-Pod</a>. They will not be reviewed anonymously, and committee members will keep the following criteria in mind when reading author’s proposals:
  <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman;">
  <li>Suitability for a podcast format (no excessive jargon, no reliance on visual materials, etc.)</li>
  <li>Creating a diverse set of topics in a season</li>
  <li>Possibility of reaching out to scholars in the field for commentary, relevant review, and/or contribution to the episode</li>
  </ol></li></ul>

<p style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 700; padding-top: 15px;">Acceptances and Meeting with SMT-Pod</p>

<ol><li>Accepted authors will be notified by email approximately 2 weeks after the call for proposals closes.
<ul><li>Those authors whose proposals have not been chosen for the current season will be provided ample feedback on their work, recommendations for moving forward, and/or suggestions for other publications which may be a better fit to showcase their research.</li></ul></li>
<li>Accepted authors are encouraged to attend a Zoom meeting will be scheduled shortly after acceptances are sent. Authors will be presented with resources and guidelines, detailed schedules, and have the opportunity to ask questions to both the program and production committee.
<ul><li>This meeting will also include a discussion on obtaining copyright permissions for music or musical examples that are not in public domain.</li>
<li>We encourage all authors to listen to episodes from Season 1 to get ideas for their own episodes and to familiarize themselves with the production standards of SMT-Pod.</li></ul>

    <label class="accordTab-label" for="chck2">Phase 2: Recording, Production, and Peer Review</label>

    <div class="accordTab-content">
    <ol style="padding-top: 15px;">
    <li>Authors are NOT required to have prior audio recording or editing experience. If you are comfortable recording and editing audio, you are encouraged to do so for the main content of your episode (SMT-Pod will take care of final production and opening/closing credits). If you are less experienced with this technology, members of the production committee will work closely with you in all phases of production.</li>
    <li>Authors will have approximately two months to compile an audio draft of their episode. The audio draft does not need to include all musical examples but should be in a condition where the editorial board and peer reviewer can envision the final version.
    <ul><li>The audio draft must be accompanied by a complete transcript (including any interviews) for peer reviewers to follow along and comment on. If you need help with the transcript, feel free to recruit colleagues and/or students to help you or reach out to the board for resources.</li>
    <li>Authors should keep in mind that this is a draft—the peer reviewer and/or editorial board will likely request that some portions be re-recorded or restructured.</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Each episode is assigned a team of board members to listen to audio drafts, check for quality, and interact with the peer reviewer comments.
    <ul><li> Authors will be informed of the members of their team while audio drafts are being created and should use their team as a resource.</li></ul></li>
    <li> The audio draft will be sent to one of the author-chosen peer reviewers with the expectation that they return one of the following results along with detailed comments:
    <ul><li>Accept as is</li>
    <li>Accept with suggestions*</li>
    <li>Accept pending revisions*</li>
    <li>Rejection</li>
    <li style="font-style: italic">*Suggestions = can ignore; revisions = must be addressed</li></ul></li>
<li>In the spirit of our open collaborative peer review process, peer reviewers will know the author’s name and the author will know who their peer reviewer is. In the final version of the episode, authors will acknowledge the peer reviewer by name.</li>
<li>The board reserves the opportunity to reject an episode after peer review or after final production should the episode not meet expectations in production quality or academic rigor.</li>

    <div class="accordTab-content">

    <ol style="padding-top: 15px;">

    <li>Once the peer reviewer completes their commentary and renders a decision, SMT-Pod will send them to the author along with any additional guidelines.</li>
    <li>Authors will have approximately 1 month to make any necessary edits and create a final audio file (either on their own or in consultation with the production committee).</li>
    <li>Authors are responsible for any copyright permissions or infringements related to musical examples in their episode.
    <ul><li>If obtaining permissions is too challenging or problematic, consider creating a reduction of the score. Rather than obtain copyright permissions for a recording of a public domain piece, consider having students or colleagues perform the excerpts (they will be included in the credits and show notes!)</li></ul></li>
    <li>Authors must send the following items along with their final audio:
    <ol style="list-style-type: lower-roman; font-size: 12px;"><li>A complete transcript of the episode (not including timestamps) – follow the
    structure of transcripts found on our <a href="https://smt-pod.org/episodes/season01/">website in the podcast player</a> (see TRANSCRIPT tab for individual episodes).</li>
    <li>Approximately 100-word bio for the website</li>
    <li>A one sentence summary of the episode (this will be read during the introduction; board may edit for length or clarity)</li>
    <li>A headshot (preferably a fun, candid shot, perhaps while recording the episode)</li>
    <li>Five (5) Keywords</li>
    <li>Supplemental materials following the formatting and reference guidelines
    from the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-o_rsLMzxB1-N8Yqak5hzPdl1ujXhHMPZZXb660PFIQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">provided template</a></li>
    <li>A separate sound file of acknowledgements (authors must thank their peer reviewer)</li>
    <li>An audio clip pronouncing author’s name (or any other names in the episode)</li>
    <li>Any credits or additional details to include in the show notes</li>
    <li>Any websites/social media handles (if you have them)</li></ol></li>
<li>Authors will be sent the final episode audio and will be able to provide one round of final edits.</li></ol>
