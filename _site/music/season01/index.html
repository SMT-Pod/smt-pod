<p>Liam is a music theorist from Amherst, Massachusetts, currently teaching at Yale University, with specializations in modern Japanese and Renaissance European forms of tonality. This research usually involves trying to figure out how irreconcilable ways of thinking about pitch have dealt with each other, as well as the entertainingly vexing question of what modes and keys even are. Liam also plays cello; some amount of guitar, piano, and voice; and enjoys learning new languages and notation systems, both musical and verbal. Writing music, mostly in antiquated idioms, has been a favorite pastime ever since meeting an E-sharp in high school orchestra. Liam has publications in the <em>Analytical Approaches to World Music</em> and <em>Intégral</em> journals, and has a few translations of too-little-known old texts on the way.</p>
