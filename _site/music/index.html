      <h1>Featured Music</h1>
    </div>
</div>

<p>As part of our mission to include diverse voices in our scholarship, <em>SMT-Pod</em> aims to showcase a variety of music in our podcast. We encourage SMT members and non-members alike to submit their compositions for both theme and bumper music. All music will be credited verbally on the episode and in writing here.</p>

<div id="features">
  <h2>Call for Music</h2>
  <p>SMT-Pod invites music makers to submit recordings for theme music and transitional (bumper) music for the upcoming season of the podcast. See more info <a href="callformusic">here</a>.</p>

<div id="features">
    <h2>Featured Musicians</h2>
    <p>Theme music composer bios appear <a href="#composerbios">below</a>. Visit our season pages to read more about composers and performers featured in each season's episodes:</p>
    <ul><li><a href="season01">Season 1 (Spring 2022) Music</a></li>
    <li><a href="season02">Season 2 (Spring 2023) Music</a></li>
    <li><a href="season03">Season 3 (Spring 2024) Music</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>Compositions were submitted as part of a Call for Compositions (see archived call below). Theme and closing music were selected from the submissions by a panel  of judges consisting of the members of the Editorial Board. Bumper/transitional music is chosen on an as-needed basis from the corpus of submissions.</p>

    <p>Credits for individual episodes can also be seen on our <a href="/episodes">Episode Archive</a> pages.</p>
