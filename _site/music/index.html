In 2024, Zhang received her Doctor of Music Arts degree from the University of Toronto, where she was composer in residence for the University of Toronto symphony orchestra.

Her music synthesizes the diﬀerent worlds she was interested in from a young age — Western classical music and traditional Chinese concepts — organically combining those elements consciously and subconsciously. The fluidity and resonance that are the vitality of her music come from influences of impressionism and post-spectralism. Her works are performed in China, America, and Canada, with recent performances at the Asian Classical Music Initiative International Conference, the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, Columbia University, and Wuhan Qintai Concert Hall.</p>
