<h4><strong>Serge Bulat</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;"><a href="https://sergebulat.com" target="_blank">Composer's Website</a><br />
Untitled work featured in <a href="/episodes/season02/#e2.5">Episode 2.5</a></p>
<p>Serge Bulat is a Moldovan-American multidisciplinary artist, composer and sound designer, who has been contributing to both European and American art scenes, exploring various mediums: from music and visuals to video games, radio and theater productions. </p>

<p>The artist's most notable to date works are "Queuelbum" (IMA award for Best Electronic Album);  project "Inkblot"  designed as a psychological test but expanded by additional senses (presented at music and art festivals around the world); and the immersive art game "Wurroom." </p>

<p>Bulat's artistic approach is often perceived as a meditation on arts, philosophy, science, and society; and explores such diverse subjects as creativity, technology, reality, culture, and identity. Recent artistic activities include the release of the multi-format albums "Wurmenai", "Similarities Between Fish And A Chair" (a collaboration with artists from 10 countries), and the score for the experimental video game "Isolomus."</p>

<h4><strong>Thomas Yee</strong></h4>
<p style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: bold;">Piece Title: "Interlude - Whether to Forgive?” from <em>Eva and the Angel of Death</em> featured in <a href="/episodes/season02/#e2.3">Episode 2.3</a></p>
<p>Some composers found their love of music at the symphony hearing Brahms or Beethoven — Thomas (b. 1992) discovered his from the beeps and boops of the family Super Nintendo. Blending the roles of composer and music theorist, Thomas specializes in writing for percussion, wind ensemble, and Holocaust remembrance music; his research focuses on music semiotics and the representation of gender, race, and religion in video game music. Thomas completed his DMA at the University of Texas at Austin and is Assistant Professor of Instruction in Music Theory at the University of Texas at San Antonio.</p>
