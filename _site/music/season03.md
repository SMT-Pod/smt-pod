We encourage SMT members and non-members alike to submit their compositions for both theme and bumper music. All music will be credited verbally on the episode and in writing here.

Piece Titles: Segments from <em>Eva and the Angel of Death</em> - A Holocaust Rememberance Opera, <em>Earthrise for Saxophone Quartet</em>, and <em>Concerto Ludus for Piano and Gameboy</em> featured in <a href="/episodes/season03/#e3.5">Episode 3.5</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Some composers found their love of music hearing Brahms or Beethoven â€” Thomas (b. 1992) discovered his from the beeps and boops of the Super Nintendo. Thomas composes transformative Holocaust Remembrance opera (<em><a href="https://vimeo.com/793376598" target="_blank">Eva and the Angel of Death</a></em>) and concert pieces remixing live performance with the chiptune aesthetics of retro video game soundworlds. Thomas' research analyzes the representation of gender, race, and religion in video game music and the compositional innovations of Japanese 8-bit era video game composers. Thomas is Assistant Professor of Instruction in Theory & Composition at the <a href="https://colfa.utsa.edu/music/" target="_blank">University of Texas at San Antonio School of Music</a>.
