        <p><strong>Bio:</strong> Mazbou Q is an artist, producer, and educator of Igbo-Nigerian descent whose work explores the intersections of hip hop, rhythm theory, and cultural identity. Drawing from classical, heavy metal, and West African Highlife influences, his music and scholarship highlight the complexity of rap flow through concepts such as polymetricism, microtiming, and syncopation. Known widely as "The Rap Scientist," he has guest lectured at institutions including Harvard University, Berklee College of Music, Louisiana State University and NYU Steinhardt. As both a practitioner and theorist, Mazbou Q continues to engage artists, scholars, and educators in the evolving study of hip hop rhythm and flow.
