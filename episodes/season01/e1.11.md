<p><strong>Bios</strong> </p>
<p>Tyler Howie is a PhD candidate in music theory at the University of Texas at Austin. Tyler is interested in post-punk aesthetics and the interactions of schema theory, topic theory and genre theory. He has presented research at regional and international conferences, including at the Sixth International Conference on Music and Minimalism (in 2017) and the Punk Scholars Network Global Punk Conference (in 2020). Tyler has also published a paper on Steve Reich’s <em>Mallet Quartet</em> with Matt Chiu for 50th anniversary of Reich’s <em>Drumming</em>. Though this is their first time recording it, this is not the first time Tyler and Matt have talked for almost an hour about emo.</p>

<p>Matt Chiu is a PhD candidate in music theory at the Eastman School of Music. Matt primarily researches early 20th century tonal repertoires and contemporary indie punk genres with computational/probabilistic technologies. His recent publications and presentations develop machine-learning techniques for metric categorization, study microtiming deviations between genres, use audio engineering techniques to analyze timbre, and relate musical “macroharmonies” to large-scale formal structures. Outside of theory, Matt has enjoyed opportunities as a church organist, musical director, bar pianist, and circus accompanist/arranger. He lives happily with his piano four hands partner (and partner) Eron, and their 2 cats—all four of them enjoy birding in their own way.</p>
