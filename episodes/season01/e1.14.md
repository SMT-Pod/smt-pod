<p><strong>Bio:</strong> Landon Morrison is a Lecturer in the Music Department at Harvard University, where he teaches courses on a wide range of topics, including timbre, popular music analysis, and sound studies. More broadly, his research aims to draw theories of music and media into a cross-disciplinary dialogue that examines technocultural mediation in contemporary sonic practices. He has presented his work at many (inter)national conferences and published in leading journals, including <em>Music Theory Online</em> (2021, 2015), <em>Circuit</em> (2019, 2018), <em>Nuove Musiche</em> (2018), and <em>Kalfou</em> (forthcoming). Most recently, he contributed a chapter to the <em>Oxford Handbook of Time in Music</em> (2021), where he sketches a history of rhythm quantization, examining its attendant technologies and reception within the context of various popular music genres. Outside of academic life, he enjoys playing piano, violin, and guitar, as well as noodling on synthesizersâ€”a hobby put to use in creating a soundtrack for his SMT-Pod episode.</p>
